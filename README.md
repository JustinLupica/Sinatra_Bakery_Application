# My Sinatra Application

My sinatra application is a generic bakery management application that I wanted the user to be able to easily manage things such as:
Taking customer's orders, adding customer's to the database and be able to track how many orders they have placed with the company, add products into the database, and create associations between the customers and their orders, and the products the customers order through their orders.

## Installation

Run 'bundle install' in your terminal after cloning the project and cd-ing into the project directory.

```bash
bundle install
```
